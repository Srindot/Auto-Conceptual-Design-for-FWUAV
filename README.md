# Neural Network for Predicting Plane Dimensions and Airfoils

## Purpose
This project aims to develop a neural network and algorithm that predicts the plane dimensions and airfoils for a given wing area specification, motor, weight, time of flight, endurance, and altitude. The goal is to optimize the design of fixed-wing autonomous unmanned vehicles (FWAUVs) for various applications.

## Methodology
We are training a neural network using data from the PTERA software. The neural network takes into account the following parameters:
- Dimensions
- Airspeed
- Angle of attack
- Flapping period

An algorithm is then used to find the best specifications for the given inputs, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.

## Data
The data used for training the neural network is sourced from the PTERA software, which provides comprehensive information on various aircraft configurations and their performance metrics.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srindot/Auto-Conceptual-Design-for-FWUAV.git
